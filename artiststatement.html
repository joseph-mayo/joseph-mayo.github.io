		<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
		<p>
			Photography has changed the way I view life. I now know the true value of time and genuinely enjoy capturing moments in life that are special to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because we are constantly moving forward in time, we reflect on the past with nostalgia. Reflection is important but it often fades. Photography allows us to preserve memories to remember for a lifetime. Photos allow us to tell stories in ways that simply can not be expressed with words.
		</p>

			Presented are photos I took during my first winter break in college. As a skateboarder, I am able to roam the streets freely and on the way I try to capture as many moments as I can for I know they may not happen again. To me, photography is not just about how it looks but what it embodies ­ an actual experience. Skating is a fast and adventurous experience, so it’s an extraordinary story to tell. My photos are what allows me to tell these stories and can be dynamic enough to tell it from many different perspectives.

			Seeing that photography became an important experience for me, I want to share this with others. I hope to professionally photograph for others so I am able capture moments of other people’s lives that they can preserve.
